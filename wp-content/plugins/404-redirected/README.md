Redirects can also be created based on the best possible match for the URL the visitor was most likely trying to reach.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### How long does it take for 404 URLs to start showing up? ###

As long as the "Capture incoming 404 URLs" option is enabled in the options section, the 404 URLs will show up in the captured list as soon as a visitor hits a 404 page.

### Will there be a slow down on my site when running the plugin? ###

No, there should be no noticeable slow down when running the plugin on your site.

### Will this plugin redirect my pages if I change my permalinks structure? ###

Yes! Redirectioner records the page/post ID number and looks up the most current permalink before redirecting the user.

### Can I redirect all 404's to a particular page? ###

No, that's not what this plugin is for. This plugin is designed to make your visitors experience better by automatically fixing 404 problems caused by typos.
